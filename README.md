im a COMEPLETE. beginner. like today i learnt what classes and the def function do. 
i understand there are way more efficent ways to write this code and not make it 100+ lines
im only about 16 gonna turn 17, took cs as my main subject in school i know a LITTLE about computers, mainly from trying to fix my godforsaken old pc 
my school is still only teaching like lists, tuples, dictionary basic stuff like that but i had no idea where to even begin and im so PROUD i didnt use chatgpt on this
THANK U FELLOW GITHUBBERS FOR YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND INSIGHTS.
